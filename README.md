# The MDL Programming Language

This repository contains a Markdown representation of *The MDL 
Programming Language* by S. W. Galley and Greg Pfister, originally 
written with support from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the 
Department of Defense (DARPA).

## Development disclaimer

This repository was forked from [Mark Trapp's transcription 
project](https://github.com/itafroma/mdl-docs), which includes the 
following disclaimer:

>This a personal project in its early stages of development and 
>planning. It is not ready for collaboration or a guarantee of 
>fitness. It's being made available for transparency (and so I have 
>something to point to when I want to talk about it), but be warned 
>that:
>
>- Support requests via GitHub issues or email will go unanswered and 
>ignored
>- Pull requests will be summarily rejected
>- Public progress may be minimal to non-existent for long stretches 
>at a time
>
>You're welcome to use what's here under the terms of its license (if 
>one is available) or the principles of fair use (if one is not). If 
>you like the idea/premise behind this project, I would suggest 
>starting over the way you'd want to do it yourself as I am very 
>unlikely to accept future contributions forked off of, or derived 
>from, this project's current stage of development.

That disclaimer notwithstanding, the contributors here have chosen to 
continue based on Trapp's work. **Contributions to [this 
repository](https://github.com/taradinoc/mdl-docs) are welcome.**
